    "\n",
    "1. **Motherboard**\n",
    "- The motherboard is the main circuit board that acts as the foundation of the computer. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Connects all internal components, distributing power and enabling communication between the CPU, RAM, and all peripherals.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: Motherboards come in different sizes and formats, such as ATX and Micro-ATX, which determine the size of the computer case needed. During setup, you must install the motherboard securely into the case before adding other components. \n",
    "2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**\n",
    "- Often called the \"brain\" of the computer, the CPU executes instructions and processes data. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Performs calculations and runs programs based on instructions from software and other hardware.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: The CPU is inserted into a specific socket on the motherboard. During installation, thermal paste and a heatsink or cooling fan are mounted on top of the CPU to prevent overheating. Performance depends on its clock speed (measured in gigahertz) and the number of cores. \n",
    "3. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**\n",
    "- ``RAM`` is the computer's short-term, or volatile, memory. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Temporarily stores data that the CPU is actively using for quick access. Higher RAM capacity and faster speeds allow for better multitasking and performance.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: RAM modules are inserted into dedicated slots on the motherboard. To maximize performance on some motherboards, users can install memory in pairs to enable dual-channel mode. \n",
    "4. **Storage devices**\n",
    "- Storage devices provide long-term, non-volatile storage for data, the operating system, and applications. \n",
    "``Function``: Saves and retains data even when the computer is turned off.\n",
    "- ``Types and configuration``:\n",
    "1. ```Solid State Drive (SSD)```: Uses flash memory and has no moving parts. SSDs are much faster and more reliable than traditional hard drives.\n",
    "2. ```Hard Disk Drive (HDD)```: Uses a spinning magnetic disk to store data. They offer a higher capacity for a lower cost but are slower and more vulnerable to damage.\n",
    "``Configuration``: Both SSDs and HDDs connect to the motherboard via a SATA cable or directly into an M.2 slot for high-speed SSDs. \n",
    "5. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**\n",
    "- Also known as a video card, the GPU is a processor designed for handling visual output. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Renders images, videos, and animations for display on the monitor. A dedicated GPU is essential for high-end gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: The GPU is installed into a PCI Express (PCIe) slot on the motherboard. It may require a direct power connection from the power supply. Many CPUs also include integrated graphics for basic tasks. \n",
    "6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**\n",
    "- The PSU converts electrical power from a wall outlet into the correct voltage for the computer's components. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Provides consistent, regulated power to the motherboard, CPU, storage, and other parts.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: The PSU is mounted inside the computer case. You must select a PSU with sufficient wattage to meet the power demands of all your components. \n",
    "7. **Input/Output (I/O) devices**\n",
    "- These external peripherals allow users to interact with the computer.\n",
    "1. Input devices: Hardware used to send data to the computer, such as a keyboard and mouse.\n",
    "2. Output devices: Hardware used to display results from the computer, such as a monitor, speakers, and printer.\n",

    "- This standardized contract allows software developers to write portable programs without worrying about specific hardware implementations, while enabling hardware designers to create various processor architectures (like Arm or RISC-V) that adhere to the same ISA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects of ISA in Processor Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Abstraction Layer``: The ISA serves as an abstraction layer, decoupling the complexity of the underlying hardware from the software. \n",
    "- ``Standardized Instruction Set``: It defines the specific operations the processor can perform, such as arithmetic, logical operations, memory access, and control flow. \n",
    "- H``ardware Interface``: The ISA dictates the format of instructions, the available registers, the methods for memory addressing, and other architectural features the hardware must support. \n",
    "- ``Software Portability``: By adhering to a specific ISA, software can be written once and run on different hardware platforms implementing that ISA, improving code compatibility and reusability. \n",

    "### Instruction Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer instruction types are broadly categorized into: ``Data Transfer`` (moving data between registers, memory, or I/O), ``Arithmetic`` (performing mathematical operations), Logic (performing bitwise and conditional operations), and ``Control`` (altering the program's execution flow). \n",
    "- These fundamental instruction types enable a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) to perform tasks by managing data and controlling program execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transfer Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- These instructions handle the movement of data within the computer's system, between different memory locations, and registers. \n",

    "- Fixed formats simplify hardware but waste memory, while variable formats are more memory-efficient and complex but can improve CPU performance through better register use and more flexible instructions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed-Length Instruction Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: Every instruction occupies the same, constant amount of memory space (e.g., always 4 bytes). \n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. Simpler Hardware: Easier and faster decoding because the location of the opcode and operands is always predictable. \n",
    "2. Faster Fetching: Simple design allows for quicker instruction fetching from memory. \n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Memory Waste: Instructions might not use all the allocated space, leading to inefficient memory usage. \n",
    "2. Limited Complexity: The fixed size limits the number of possible opcodes and the complexity of individual instructions. \n",
    "- **Associated Architectures**: Commonly found in Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architectures, such as ARM and SPARC. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable-Length Instruction Format** \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: Instructions can vary in length, with each instruction taking only the amount of space it needs to convey its operands. \n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "1. Better Code Density: More efficient use of memory by allocating space only as needed. \n",
    "2. More Flexibility: Allows for more complex instructions and a wider variety of addressing modes. \n",
    "3. Improved CPU Efficiency: Can lead to faster performance by more effectively using CPU registers. \n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. Complex Hardware: Requires more complex decoding logic to determine instruction length and locate fields. \n",
    "2. Slower Fetching: Fetching instructions can be more complex due to variable lengths. \n",

    "## Addressing Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing modes specify how a processor finds operands for its instructions, offering flexibility in data access. \n",
    "- Common modes include: ``immediate``, where the operand is in the instruction itself; ``register``, where the operand is in a CPU register; ``direct``, where the instruction contains the memory address of the operand; and ``indirect``, where the instruction provides the address of a memory location that holds the operand's address. \n",
    "- Other modes like ``indexed`` and ``relative`` allow for more complex memory access by using registers and offsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Addressing Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``Immediate``: The operand's value is directly included within the instruction. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, #10 (add 10 directly to R1). \n",
    "2. ``Register``: The operand is located in a CPU register. \n",
    "Example: ```MOV R1```, R2 (move the content of R2 to R1). \n",
    "3. ``Direct (Absolute)``: The instruction's address field directly contains the memory address of the operand. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, [1000] (add the content at memory address 1000 to R1). \n",
    "4. ``Indirect``: The instruction contains the memory address of another memory location, which in turn holds the actual operand's address. \n",
    "Example: ``ADD R1``, [[1000]] (add the content at the memory address pointed to by the value at memory address 1000 to R1). \n",
    "5. ``Indexed``: The effective address is found by adding the content of an index register to a base address or offset provided in the instruction. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, [Base_Address + Index_Register]. \n",
    "6. ``Relative``: The effective address is calculated by adding an offset to the contents of the Program Counter (PC). This helps in making code relocatable. \n",
    "Example: The instruction's address field acts as an offset relative to the current instruction's address. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Addressing Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: They provide various ways for instructions to access data, allowing for different programming needs. \n",
    "- Efficiency: They enable efficient use of memory and CPU resources by defining the most suitable method for operand retrieval. \n",
    "Instruction Design: They contribute to the design of instruction sets, influencing instruction length and complexity. "
