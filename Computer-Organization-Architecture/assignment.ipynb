    "\n",
    "1. **Motherboard**\n",
    "- The motherboard is the main circuit board that acts as the foundation of the computer. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Connects all internal components, distributing power and enabling communication between the CPU, RAM, and all peripherals.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: Motherboards come in different sizes and formats, such as ATX and Micro-ATX, which determine the size of the computer case needed. During setup, you must install the motherboard securely into the case before adding other components. \n",
    "2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**\n",
    "- Often called the \"brain\" of the computer, the CPU executes instructions and processes data. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Performs calculations and runs programs based on instructions from software and other hardware.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: The CPU is inserted into a specific socket on the motherboard. During installation, thermal paste and a heatsink or cooling fan are mounted on top of the CPU to prevent overheating. Performance depends on its clock speed (measured in gigahertz) and the number of cores. \n",
    "3. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**\n",
    "- ``RAM`` is the computer's short-term, or volatile, memory. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Temporarily stores data that the CPU is actively using for quick access. Higher RAM capacity and faster speeds allow for better multitasking and performance.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: RAM modules are inserted into dedicated slots on the motherboard. To maximize performance on some motherboards, users can install memory in pairs to enable dual-channel mode. \n",
    "4. **Storage devices**\n",
    "- Storage devices provide long-term, non-volatile storage for data, the operating system, and applications. \n",

    "- ``Configuration``: The GPU is installed into a PCI Express (PCIe) slot on the motherboard. It may require a direct power connection from the power supply. Many CPUs also include integrated graphics for basic tasks. \n",
    "6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**\n",
    "- The PSU converts electrical power from a wall outlet into the correct voltage for the computer's components. \n",
    "- ``Function``: Provides consistent, regulated power to the motherboard, CPU, storage, and other parts.\n",
    "- ``Configuration``: The PSU is mounted inside the computer case. You must select a PSU with sufficient wattage to meet the power demands of all your components. \n",
    "7. **Input/Output (I/O) devices**\n",
    "- These external peripherals allow users to interact with the computer.\n",
    "1. Input devices: Hardware used to send data to the computer, such as a keyboard and mouse.\n",
    "2. Output devices: Hardware used to display results from the computer, such as a monitor, speakers, and printer.\n",

    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Memory Waste: Instructions might not use all the allocated space, leading to inefficient memory usage. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Addressing modes specify how a processor finds operands for its instructions, offering flexibility in data access. \n",
    "- Common modes include: ``immediate``, where the operand is in the instruction itself; ``register``, where the operand is in a CPU register; ``direct``, where the instruction contains the memory address of the operand; and ``indirect``, where the instruction provides the address of a memory location that holds the operand's address. \n",
    "- Other modes like ``indexed`` and ``relative`` allow for more complex memory access by using registers and offsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Addressing Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``Immediate``: The operand's value is directly included within the instruction. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, #10 (add 10 directly to R1). \n",
    "2. ``Register``: The operand is located in a CPU register. \n",
    "Example: ```MOV R1```, R2 (move the content of R2 to R1). \n",
    "3. ``Direct (Absolute)``: The instruction's address field directly contains the memory address of the operand. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, [1000] (add the content at memory address 1000 to R1). \n",
    "4. ``Indirect``: The instruction contains the memory address of another memory location, which in turn holds the actual operand's address. \n",
    "Example: ``ADD R1``, [[1000]] (add the content at the memory address pointed to by the value at memory address 1000 to R1). \n",
    "5. ``Indexed``: The effective address is found by adding the content of an index register to a base address or offset provided in the instruction. \n",
    "Example: ```ADD R1```, [Base_Address + Index_Register]. \n",
    "6. ``Relative``: The effective address is calculated by adding an offset to the contents of the Program Counter (PC). This helps in making code relocatable. \n",
    "Example: The instruction's address field acts as an offset relative to the current instruction's address. \n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Base-Relative Addressing** \n",
    "Example:``` STR R6, [R11, #77]``` (ARM architecture)\n",

    "## LMC Memory Addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Little Man Computer (LMC) exclusively uses ``direct addressing`` for its instructions. \n",
    "- This means that when an instruction refers to a memory location, it directly uses that location's address to access the data. \n",
    "- Other common addressing modes, such as ``immediate``, ``indirect``, or ``indexed``, are not supported by the standard LMC and will typically be interpreted by a simulator as a memory address, leading to unexpected results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How Direct Addressing Works in LMC** \n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Operand`` is a Memory Address: In LMC, the ``operand`` for data-manipulating instructions like ``LDA (Load)``, ``STA (Store)``, ``ADD (Add)``, and ``SUB (Subtract)`` is a mailbox (memory location) address.\n",
    "- Two-Step Process (from a high-level perspective):\n",
    "1. The instruction specifies a mailbox number ``(e.g., LDA 50)``.\n",
    "2. The \"little man\" fetches the value from that specific mailbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Other Modes Don't Apply**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``No Immediate Addressing``: Unlike some other systems, LMC does not support immediate addressing, where the data value itself is the operand. If you try to use an immediate value, the LMC simulator will treat it as a memory address, causing errors. \n",
    "- ``No Indirect or Indexed Addressing``: ``Indirect`` and ``indexed`` addressing modes, which involve looking up an address or adding an offset to find the data, are also not part of the LMC's design. \n",
    "- In essence, LMC's simplicity means that any number in an instruction is always a direct reference to a memory location containing the data to be used. "
